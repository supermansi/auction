Auction

Technocrat's Premier League (TPL) - Bidding Process

TPL was a cricket tournament held at my institute. I created a simple Java program to conduct the auction in a simplified and automated way. 

Specifications are as follows:

Each captain is given a base point of 500. All players have their worth as follows:

Grade   Worth
A       40
B       30
C       20
D       10

Similarly the captains have worth of 100(A) and 60(B).

I will assume there are 70 players. Hence, 7 teams each containing 9 players + 1 captain.

Team  Captain Grade Points
1	A	400
2	A	400
3	B	360
4	A	400
5	B	360
6	A	400
7	B	360

The basic formula used is ''' X[i]-Y[i]/N '''

Bidding process for cricket team TPL

This file contains a simple Java program for a bidding process in a cricket tournament that was held at my institue. Specifications follow;
Each captain is given a base point of 500. All players have their worth as follows:
Grade   Worth
A       40
B       30
C       20
D       10
Similarly the captains have worth of 100(A) and 60(B).
I will assume there are 70 players. Hence, 7 teams each containing 9 players + 1 captain.
Team  Captain Grade Points
1     A             400
2     A             400
